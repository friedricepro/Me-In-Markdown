Hello! My name is Timothy Hermanto and I'm currently a sophomore at Chatsworth Charter Highschool. I am in the magnet program and my favorite class last year was honors biology with Mrs Lopez. I am from Indonesia, but my ethnicity is actually Chinese. Currently I am taking 3 AP's (Seminar, World History, and CSA), 2 Honors (Geometry and Chemistry), and my elective is Conceptual Design. Last year I got all A's throughout my freshman year, ending it off with getting a 4 on the APCSP exam. The first few weeks of my summer I took an in-person PE class to get my credit from it, I found that I actually liked to play tennis and volleyball from it. The rest of my summer I took another class but it was asynchronous so I was able to go on vacation through many states such as Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Idaho, Utah, South Dakota, and Nevada.

That's enough about my academics though. A few hobbies I have are hiking outside, playing horror games with my friends (not alone though), going to the arcade, traveling, drawing, trying to improve myself, and im currently trying to learn how to cook new things. I love mainly asian cuisine, some of my favorite foods consist of soy garlic korean chicken wings, dumplings, beef fried rice, springrolls, orange chicken, beef chow mein, chicken katsu, tempura, mushroom tofu, and many more. Aside from that, I'm also an only child and my goal for colleges/universties consist of  mainly UCLA and UCI, maybe some out of state but I'd need to think about it a bit more. An additional hobby I have is collecting things, like pokemon cards and figurines, I enjoy japanese culture and sometimes watch anime but most of my time is dedicated towards family or studies. Going more depth into video games I play, I enjoy Pokemon games (Favorite game is Pokemon diamond), Clash Royale, Brawl Stars, Minecraft, Roblox, and chess, although I do enjoy a face-to-face chess game as well. 

For this school year I will try to of course maintain all A's in my classes, but a new goal I have is to get atleast a 4 or more on every AP exam. This year I will dedicate most of my time to studying for my AP's and in CSA I hope I will be able to learn to code fluently in java by the end of the year. Some of my more personal plans are to learn how to cook, get my drivers license, maybe get a job, take care of the house by myself, join a few clubs, and get some volunteering hours done. I'm a pretty chill guy I'd say, most periods I don't have any sworn enemies but I don't have too many close friends either. Ranking my classes in freshman years it would go like :

1 Honors Biology (Mrs Lopez) - Fun labs, friendly and smaller period, gave me a reason to wake up, I passed both semesters with a 97% using no extra credit.
2 Honors English (Ms Ramos) - Simple class, funny teacher, good table I sat at, praticed presentations, lighter workload, overall solid.
3 APCSP (Mr Levin) - Class had like 7 people, no trouble makers, we basically got to do whatever we wanted to, code.org was fun.
4 Honors Algebra 1 (Mr Tsai) - Period had many troublemakers, although funny period learning was hard, you could correct work for 100% of the missing credit.
5 Adv PE - Many many troublemakers, running during the summers was NOT nice, our free playtime period on fridays was taken away because for some reason my period would rather play on their phone in a corner than play with other people.
6 Spanish 1 (Ms Gonzalez) - Horrible period, many troublemakers, a lot of yelling, course material did not line up to material being tested on, far away from lunch line so I always got lunch late.
